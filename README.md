HEY my name is Michael, Today im going to try to make a chess game using JavaScript, Html, and CSS. If everything is successful, this what i plan to do next:

• launch the game on the github pages

• Make it so the user can choose dark more or light mode(maybe affect the pieces)

• make the web page resposive with the user's device

• Further customize the game 
    • such as adding a bot
    • Trying to add stockingfich

• Trying to add an evolution bar The purpose is supposed to help show the state of the game
Thats what I got for now.
